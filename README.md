Won the Robo-Hackathon at CircuitLaunch in Oakland today with this project. Unfortunately didn't have enough time to add proper streaming transcription support. Voice samples are sent in 5 second chunks, which means if a command straddles a boundary, it will likely be missed.

Thanks a lot to [url=https://merklebot.com/]MerkleBot[/url] for organizing this.
