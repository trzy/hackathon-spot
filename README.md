Won the Robo-Hackathon at [CircuitLaunch](https://circuitlaunch.com) in Oakland today with this project. Unfortunately didn't have enough time to add proper streaming transcription support. Voice samples are sent in 5 second chunks, which means if a command straddles a boundary, it will likely be missed.

Thanks a lot to [MerkleBot](https://merklebot.com/) and [DuploCloud](https://duplocloud.com) for organizing this.
